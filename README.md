## Overview

The WMS allows field workers to log waste disposal activities per construction package (P4, P5, P6) for two waste categories: **Hazardous** and **Solid**. Admins manage user access, view analytics, and export reports — all backed by Google Sheets as the data store and Google Apps Script as the serverless backend.

The app is deployed as a **Progressive Web App** on GitHub Pages and can be installed directly to the home screen on Android (via Chrome) and iOS (via Safari) without going through any app store.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — no framework
- **CSS3** — custom design system with CSS variables for theming (default, dark, compact)
- **Chart.js** — trend and breakdown charts
- **jsPDF** — PDF report generation with embedded images
- **SheetJS (xlsx)** — Excel export
- **Canvas API** — GPS-stamped photo watermarking
- **Geolocation API** — GPS coordinates for photo watermarks
- **Service Worker** — push notifications, background sync, offline caching

### Backend
- **Google Apps Script** — serverless REST API (`doGet` / `doPost`)
- **Google Sheets** — data persistence (Users, waste logs, access logs, rate limits)
- **Google Drive** — photo file storage per package folder; images served as base64 via backend proxy
- **Gmail / MailApp** — HTML email notifications for access approval/rejection and new user registrations

### Google Sheets Structure

| Sheet | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Users` | Email, Status, Token, Last Login, Role, Token Expiry |
| `RateLimits` | Per-user request counters and window timestamps |
| `Requests` | Idempotency log — request IDs to prevent duplicate submissions |
| `Access_Log` | Full audit trail of all API actions with timestamps |

Per-package waste data is stored in **separate Google Sheets** (one per package per waste type), configured via Script Properties in `Code.gs`.

---

## User Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|---|---|
| `user` | Log waste entries, view own history, export own records, edit/delete own entries |
| `admin` | All user permissions + approve/reject pending users, view all records, view analytics, manage users |
| `super_admin` | All admin permissions + change user roles, delete users, full user list including other admins |

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A Google Account
- Access to Google Sheets and Google Drive
- The web app hosted on GitHub Pages or any static host

### 1. Set Up Google Sheets

Create the following sheets:
- **Users Sheet** — columns: `Email`, `Status`, `Token`, `Last Login`, `Role`, `Token Expiry`
- **Per-package waste sheets** — for P4, P5, P6 (both hazardous and solid) — each with a `Sheet1` tab

Copy each Sheet ID from the URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SHEET_ID/edit`

### 2. Set Up Google Drive Folders

Create a Google Drive folder per package (P4, P5, P6) for each waste type to store uploaded photos. Copy each folder ID from the URL: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/FOLDER_ID`

### 3. Configure the Backend Script (Script Properties)

All sensitive IDs are stored as **Script Properties** — never hardcoded in source.

In the Apps Script editor → **Project Settings → Script Properties**, add:

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| `USER_SHEET_ID` | ID of your Users sheet |
| `P4_HAZ_SHEET_ID` | ID of P4 hazardous sheet |
| `P4_HAZ_FOLDER_ID` | ID of P4 hazardous Drive folder |
| `P5_HAZ_SHEET_ID` | ID of P5 hazardous sheet |
| `P5_HAZ_FOLDER_ID` | ID of P5 hazardous Drive folder |
| `P6_HAZ_SHEET_ID` | ID of P6 hazardous sheet |
| `P6_HAZ_FOLDER_ID` | ID of P6 hazardous Drive folder |
| `P4_SOLID_SHEET_ID` | ID of P4 solid sheet |
| `P4_SOLID_FOLDER_ID` | ID of P4 solid Drive folder |
| `P5_SOLID_SHEET_ID` | ID of P5 solid sheet |
| `P5_SOLID_FOLDER_ID` | ID of P5 solid Drive folder |
| `P6_SOLID_SHEET_ID` | ID of P6 solid sheet |
| `P6_SOLID_FOLDER_ID` | ID of P6 solid Drive folder |

Alternatively, uncomment and run `setScriptProperties_RUN_ONCE()` in `Code.gs` after filling in your IDs, then delete it.

### 4. Deploy the Google Apps Script

1. Open the script in the Apps Script editor
2. Click **Deploy → New Deployment**
3. Type: **Web App**
4. Execute as: **Me**
5. Access: **Anyone**
6. Click **Deploy** and copy the deployment URL

### 5. Configure the Frontend

In `script.js`, update the Apps Script URL near the top of the file:

```javascript
const scriptURL = "https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID/exec";
```

Also update the Google OAuth Client ID if needed:

```javascript
const GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = "YOUR_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com";
```

### 6. Deploy the Frontend

Push all files to GitHub Pages or any static host. Ensure `manifest.json` and `sw.js` are served from the same origin as `index.html`.

## Security

- **Google OAuth 2.0** — sign-in handled via Google Identity Services; only the verified email is used
- **Token-based sessions** — UUID tokens stored in Google Sheets, validated server-side on every request
- **Token expiry** — 7-day rolling window; expired tokens are cleared automatically on validation
- **Rate limiting** — 100 requests/hour per user, enforced server-side in a dedicated Sheets tab
- **Role-based access control** — enforced on all admin and super-admin endpoints
- **Idempotency** — `requestId` (UUID per submission) prevents duplicate entries on network retry
- **Formula injection prevention** — all user input sanitised before writing to Sheets
- **Audit log** — every API action, email, and success/failure outcome logged to `Access_Log`
- **No secrets in source** — all Sheet IDs, folder IDs stored in Script Properties, never in code
- **Email notifications** — users notified on approval/rejection; admins notified on new registrations

---

## Deployment

The app is a static SPA deployable to any host. The backend is a Google Apps Script Web App — no server infrastructure required.

**Live URL**:  [https://francisalbertespina-spec.github.io/Waste-log-sandbox/](https://francisalbertespina-spec.github.io/Waste-log-sandbox/)

To deploy updates:
1. Edit `script.js`, `style.css`, or `index.html`
2. Push to the `main` branch on GitHub
3. GitHub Pages auto-deploys within ~60 seconds
4. For backend changes, redeploy `Code.gs` as a **New Version** in Apps Script → Deploy → Manage Deployments
